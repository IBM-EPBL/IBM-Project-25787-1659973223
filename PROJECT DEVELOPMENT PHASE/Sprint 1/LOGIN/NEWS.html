                PENNSYLVANIA REELECTS STATE DEMOCRAT THAT DIED IN EARLY OCTOBER
            </h4>
            <p>
                What a let down Pennsylvania was for Republicans for these midterm elections. The state was so successful at not contributing to a red wave of Republican wins that it actually even elected a deceased Democrat. Anthony “Tony” DeLuca was reelected in the Pennsylvania State House which would make him the longest-serving state representative; if he was still living. However, he died in October.

                England fell to a stunning five-run loss to Ireland on Wednesday in the 2022 T20 World Cup, throwing the race for a semi-final spot in Group 1 wide open. Chasing a target of 158, England were limited to a score of 105/5 in 14.3 overs before rain caused the match to be called off.

              Putin: Russia will soon be able to counter hypersonic weapons
            </h4>
            <p>
              For years specialists and military insiders have warned the U.S. has fallen behind its chief competitors, China and Russia, in the development of the weapons. Catching up and ensuring the U.S. is on par with its foes, and has the capability to defend against hypersonics in the event enemies deploy them, has become a top priority inside the Pentagon.

              “Climate Change” No Cause for Alarm
            </h4>
            <p>
              Goklany points out that the improvements in the human condition have occurred not in spite of fossil-fuel usage but because of it. Life expectancy has grown rapidly. Global poverty has shrunk. The planet has become greener because plants consume carbon dioxide, a fact known since at least 1804. We are growing more crops on less land, thanks especially to nitrogen fertilizers and synthetic pesticides, both of which are products or byproducts of fossil fuels.
